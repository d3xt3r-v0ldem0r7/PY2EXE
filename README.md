simple python script compailer

this is software will help you to save the time instead
you type a long command to compaile a python script

(fun fact is you gonna compaile your python file in my software,which is also written in python,
 python script compaile in python script wtf...lol)

this is not gonna help you to compaile complex files & big prog like enterprise,etc...
this is for newbies and who hate to type commands
it compaile small & medium progs

my prog is not new, it do the work same as pyinstaller
it automate your work just do by gui and it execute the command
depend on your file to the pyinstaller and pyinstaller process is 
printed.

{ sry, i know the tkinter(gui) window hang when you compaile
  b'cos the pyinstaller output is printing in cmd console to
  show you if your file is have some compailing errors &
  i write this in small time so i cant rectify the console &
  windowed func in as one func make sure i solve the prob 
  as soon as possible}

take look on my prog :
